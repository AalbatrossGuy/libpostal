Hi!

I was checking out the awesome libpostal, and saw something that could be improved.

#### My country is
<!-- If you were Carmen Sandiego, where in the world would you be? -->

---
#### Here's how I'm using libpostal
<!-- Always interested to know how people use the library! What are you working on? Which organization? What's your use case? -->

---
#### Here's what I did
<!-- the input you used in the case of results issues, your system configuration for compilation issues/bugs, etc. -->

---
#### Here's what I got
<!-- the output from the parser or make, etc. Try to paste the exact result/output. -->

---
#### Here's what I was expecting
<!-- what should the correct parse/output have been? Try to be specific. -->

---
#### For parsing issues, please check all that apply

- [ ] Does the input address exist in [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org)?
- [ ] Do all the toponyms exist in OSM (city, state, region names, etc.)?
- [ ] If the address uses a rare/uncommon format, does changing the order of the fields yield the correct result?
- [ ] If the address does not contain city, region, etc., does adding those fields to the input improve the result?
- [ ] If the address contains apartment/floor/sub-building information or uncommon formatting, does removing that help? Is there any minimum form of the address that gets the right parse?

#### Here's what I think could be improved
<!-- suggestions for what could be done differently -->
